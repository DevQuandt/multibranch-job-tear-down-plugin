    This plugin only works with Multibranch pipeline projects. When a particular branch is delete this plugin will trigger
    another job with the `git_url` and `branch_name` of the job being deleted. This way you can perform any cleanup
    you desired like bringing down servers. By default this plugin looks for a job called `job-tear-down-executor`. Or you may
    use the `branchTearDownExecutor` to configure it for your project
